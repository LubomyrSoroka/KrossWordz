# KrossWordz - Native Crossword Puzzle App

A native Qt/Python application for crossword puzzles that supports .ipuz file format.

## Features
- Load `.ipuz` files
- Interactive crossword grid with keyboard/mouse editing and pencil mode
- Clue display, navigation, highlighting, and clue lookup
- Timer tracking with pause/resume controls
- Check/reveal tools for letters, words, or the entire grid
- Enter Rebuses (hold down shift)
- Save and restore progress inside the `.ipuz` file
- Optional AI-powered clue explanations through Gemini
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Overlays that can be displayed when the puzzle starts and is completed (see overlays to see how they work)

## Dependencies
- PySide6 (Qt6 for Python)
- Python 3.8+

## Quick Start
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
# Optionally launch with a puzzle already selected
python src/main.py path/to/puzzle.ipuz
```

### Gemini AI Integration
CrossWordz can ask Google’s Gemini models to explain any clue. Set your Gemini API key in **Preferences → AI** (stored via `QSettings`) and the AI tab becomes active. Without a key, CrossWordz runs normally; the AI tab simply shows a reminder to configure the key.

## Overlays
To include an overlay with a puzzle, in the same directory as the puzzle include a file with the same name as the puzzle ending with _start or _end. E.g. if you have a puzzle called 
myPuzzle.ipuz, then in the same directory include myPuzzle_start.png and myPuzzle_end.png to include overlays in the puzzle (both are optional). An overlay can either by .png or .gif file.

## Build a macOS App Bundle
The project ships with a PyInstaller spec that produces a signed-ready `.app` bundle with a native `.ipuz` file association.

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt pyinstaller
pyinstaller --clean --noconfirm packaging/crosswordz-mac.spec
```

After the build finishes, move `dist/CrossWordz.app` into `/Applications`. macOS will read the embedded `CFBundleDocumentTypes` metadata so that `.ipuz` files show CrossWordz as the default app. Double-clicking a puzzle (or dragging it onto the Dock icon) now launches CrossWordz and loads the file immediately. If Finder was already associating `.ipuz` files with another program, open any `.ipuz` file's **Get Info** pane, change **Open with** to CrossWordz, and click **Change All...** once.
